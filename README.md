This project is a group Project done to fullfil the COE 301 Requirements.

This repository contains Python code that uses PyTorch to implement a neural network classifier for the Iris dataset. The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in machine learning, containing measurements for 150 iris flowers from three different species.

## About the Dataset

The Iris dataset consists of four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The task is to classify the iris flowers into one of three species: setosa, versicolor, or virginica.

## Requirements

To run the code, you need to have Python installed on your system along with the following libraries:
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- matplotlib

You can install these dependencies using pip:
